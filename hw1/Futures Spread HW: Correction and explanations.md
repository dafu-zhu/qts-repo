In HW1, I mistakenly asked you to use two different digits of your ID.  I only want you to do one row of the list from the PDF, e.g. `NQ versus ES`.    This is apparently the reason we fielded so many questions about 4 spreads versus 2 spreads on Ed Discussion.

I do not care too much which digit from your student number you use, but whatever your choice, you are required to treat only one row from the PDF.

Furthermore, with respect to sparse data:

(A) Let's choose our two months by top number of rows in the data set. 

For example, 6J's best expirations are H6 and F6. SR1 is V6 and X6 with N=457 and N=458 rows. Most but not all others are Z5 and F6. 

(B) Some sparse contracts have only a couple dozen data points (ZTZ5, ZFZ5, UBZ5) -- the rest all have at least a couple hundred.  In all cases, but especially sparsely quoted ones, make sure that on days where a data point exists, forward-fill the price for that day.
